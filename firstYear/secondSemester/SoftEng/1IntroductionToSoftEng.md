# General concepts of Software Engineering

## Definition of Software Engineering
**Multi person** construction of **multi version**:
- multi person $\implies$ a _team_ is in charge of making software, not a single person;
- multi version $\implies$ software is realized with the intention of existing in a long time, so versioning is necessary. It includes concepts as custom-made (software is an investment for many year), versioning (recover, rebuild previous versions).

A software is a collection of computer programs, procedures, rules, associated documentation (because not all people involved in the project know all the details, so it resumes them) and data. 
Example of documentation are requirements documents, project plan, test plan, test case, build/deployment scripts, user manuals. 

## Software types 
Closely related to criticality of the software.
- Embedded in non software product, such as cars, washing machines;
- Stand alone as office suite, social network;
- Embedded enterprise, with the idea of helping businesses to collect data (information systems).

## Software criticality
Problems related to software can be innocents or very damaging. 
They can be classified by means of damaged part:
- safety critical, they can harms people or environment (usually caused by embedded systems);
- mission critical harms businesses.

## Software beware
Software is not free, it is often subject to change and is really complex (so not perfect).

## Process and product
We can compare classical engineering to software engineering.
