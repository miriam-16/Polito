# Binary Classification - Fingerprint 
The project task consists of a binary classification problem. The goal is to perform fingerprint spoofing detection, i.e. to identify genuine vs counterfeit fingerprint images. The dataset consists of labeled samples corresponding to the genuine (True, label 1) class and the fake (False, label 0) class. The samples are computed by a feature extractor that summarizes high-level characteristics of a fingerprint image. The data is 6-dimensional.
The training files for the project are stored in file Project/trainData.txt. The format of the file is the same as for the Iris dataset, i.e. a csv file where each row represents a sample. The first 6 values of each row are the features, whereas the last value of each row represents the class (1 or 0). The samples are not ordered.

Load the dataset and plot the histogram and pair-wise scatter plots of the different features. Analyze
the plots.
1. Analyze the first two features. What do you observe? Do the classes overlap? If so, where? Do the classes show similar mean for the first two features? Are the variances similar for the two classes? 
How many modes are evident from the histograms (i.e., how many “peaks” can be observed)?
2. Analyze the third and fourth features. What do you observe? Do the classes overlap? If so, where? Do the classes show similar mean for these two features? Are the variances similar for the two classes? How many modes are evident from the histograms?
3. Analyze the last two features. What do you observe? Do the classes overlap? If so, where? How many modes are evident from the histograms? How many clusters can you notice from the scatter plots for each class?
