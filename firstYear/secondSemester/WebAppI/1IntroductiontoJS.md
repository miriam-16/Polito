# Notes of notable JS syntax
- let [x,y] = toCartesian(r,theta); allow to return multiple values from a function

- const parts = ['shoulders', 'knees'];
  const lyrics = ['head', ...parts, 'and', 'toes']; // ["head", "shoulders","knees", "and", "toes"]
  Spread the content of an array in order to list the elements from a multiple value of the array. It's called **spread operator**.
  It can be used in the reserve way, to obtain only a part of the array. In fact, it is usually used as const b = [...a] to copy the value of a in the variable b
