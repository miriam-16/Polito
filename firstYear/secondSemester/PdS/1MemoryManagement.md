# 1 - Memory management

## Background
When a task of a program has to be executed, it is transfer from disk to main memory within a process. 

As we know, CPU has direct access to main memory and registers, so it's very important to transfer the code from memory to more accessable point for the CPU.

## Problems related to management of memory
In this phase, there are problems related to:
- Space, how much data has to be transfered;
- Speed of loading and storing data;
- Dealing with a lot of processes, each of them with theri data and information that has to be managed indipendently.

## Protection
Another important property is protection, which ensure a process to access only to addresses within its address space and to prevent illegal operation.
