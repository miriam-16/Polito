// 1. adjust the lifetimes without any implementation yet: does it compile?
// 2. try to implement the function: does it compile?
// 3. if it doesn't compile, try to understand why from the compiler errors and draw all the necessary lifetimes
// 4. Spoiler: basically it's not possibile to return more then one mutable reference to the same data
// 5. Try this workaround: return a vector of indexes (first solution) and let the caller extract the mutable references
// 7. (later in the course you will learn about smart pointers, which can be used to solve this kind of problems in a more elegant way)

// In order to implement it, you may add any other attribute to the struct (remember: the struct is stateful and after each call to next() you must start from the last position found)
// The struct may be used as shown in the demo_SimpleDNAIter() function
